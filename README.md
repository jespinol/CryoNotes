### Overview
CryoEM is a widely used technique for protein structure determination, and it has become in recent times the preferred method for structural studies in our and other labs. Despite monumental advances in data collection and sample processing methods, the data processing workflows used for specific projects vary greatly, even within the same lab.
<br/>
<br/>
The goal of this project is to create a web-based app to keep track of data collection parameters, data processing parameters, and results of different cryoEM projects. My expectation is that having that information in a central location will aid in planning and executing cryoEM experiments.

### Features
Create users: an admin-level user (lab manager or principal investigator) will be able to create new users.<br/>
User login: users will be able to log in with a username and password and 2-step authentication.<br/>
CRUD: users will be able to create new projects, add details from different experiments related to a project. Authorized users will be able to delete experiments/projects when needed.<br/>
View and compare data: users will be able to view data from one project or from different projects related to the same sample.
### Technologies
Java<br/>
HTML<br/>
SQL<br/>
CSS<br/>
Thymeleaf templates<br/>
Bootstrap
### What I'll Have to Learn
How to create and manage users with different levels of access. Implement 2FA. Create, update, delete complex databases.
